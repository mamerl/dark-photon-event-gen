This module runs analyses for a given set of samples.

The outputs consist of:
- Histograms saved in ROOT files
- JSON dictionaries with cutflow information specific to each analysis
- JSON dictionaries storing the acceptance of the selection for each sample
- JSON dictionaries storing the expected signal cross-section accounting
  for the acceptance

TODO extend this script to do directly calculate whether a sample is excluded
